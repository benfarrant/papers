# Introduction
Hayword et al. (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara. 
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectromemter 
(Allen et al, 2000).


# Simulations
John has made some simulations or particle formation using his box model. It reproduces the growth in size 
distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method.
