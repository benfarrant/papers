# Abstract
We write this last because it's difficult to do.
This is where we summarise our main results so lazy people don't have to read the whole thing but can still reference it.

# Introduction
Hayword et al. (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara. 
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectromemter 
(Allen et al, 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations or particle formation using his box model. It reproduces the growth in size 
distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method.

# Methodology
We used an AMS (Allan et al, 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical composition.

#Results
We observed particle growth through coagulation and report the changing chemical composition with age in the atmosphere.

# Conclusions
We made some groundbreaking discovery, aren't we great.
There's more to do, give us more funding.

# Figures
This is where the figures go in a draft manuscript.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the EU funding body for their support. RIP :( (?)
